#An integer is just a number without a decimal part (for instance, -17, 0, and 42 are all integers, but 98.6 is not).
#For the purpose of this lesson, we'll also say that a number with a decimal part that is all 0s is also an integer, such as 7.0.
#This means that, for this lesson, you can't just test the input to see if it's of type int.
#If the difference between a number and that same number rounded is greater than zero, what does that say about that particular number?

def is_int(x):
  absolute = abs(x)
  rounded = round(absolute)
  return absolute - rounded == 0
